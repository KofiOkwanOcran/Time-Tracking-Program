#Time Tracking Program 

Business Problem

Nana recently started a consulting business where he is paid based on the number of hours and minutes he works on client projects.

He needs a time tracking program, where he enters the date and the time he started working on a task, and then the date and time when he finished a particular task.

The program calculates the hours he spent on a task. It then calculates the amount of money Nana made tackling the task.

Note that: Nana is paid $5 dollars per hour.

If Nana works from 11AM to 1:30 PM on Monday 27th July, he would make 2.5 X 5 = $12.5 dollars.

#Task

The program calculates the hours he spent on a task.
