# Time-Tracking Program

Included in this repository is a pyton code which can help one keep track of one's income as one works on a task per a given hourly rate of work.

The code accepts as its input, the date and time for starting a task and the finishing date and time.

For this work, the hourly rate was fixed at $5.00 hence there was no modification to allow the user to input that.


## How it works
Once the program is launched, one would be required to enter the starting and finishing date and time in a given format.
Per the how the code is written, the format is very critical.
The format for the date: eg 31/07/2020 (**The forward slash must be included**)
The time follows a 24hrs formart; **So if the task ended at 1:00PM, the user would have to input 13:00.**



## Output
All the details keyed in and the outputs; that's the starting and finishing date and time, the hours worked and incomed earned are all stored in a csv file named **Income.**
